 * - Inherit a class from Thread and override the run( ) method.

 *   - Repeat this three times, then return from run( ).
 * - Put a start-up message in the constructor.
 *
 * - Make a separate thread class that calls System.gc( ) inside run( ), printing a message as it does so.
 * - Make several thread objects of both types and run them to see what happens.
 * - Experiment with different sleep times to see what happens.
